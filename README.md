# Devops_TestAutomation_With_GitHub_Action

## Project Overview
This project demonstrates how to set up a basic FastAPI backend, automate API testing with Python, and integrate the tests into a GitHub Actions CI/CD pipeline. The primary goal is to understand backend API test automation, utilize GitHub Actions for continuous testing, and grasp the concepts of CI/CD in real-world DevOps workflows.

## Features
- Basic FastAPI server with endpoints for addition, subtraction, and multiplication
- Automated testing using Python's requests library
- Enhanced test suite using pytest for better reporting
- Continuous testing integration with GitHub Actions
- Real-world project considerations: database integration, authentication, and performance testing

## Technologies Used
- **Python**: Backend API development and automated testing
- **FastAPI**: Creating the RESTful API endpoints
- **Uvicorn**: ASGI server for running FastAPI
- **Requests**: Sending HTTP requests for API testing
- **Pytest**: Test framework for writing structured and automated tests
- **GitHub Actions**: Automating testing on every code change
